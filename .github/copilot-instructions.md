## Project Overview

This project uses Skillsmith for agentic AI development context.
See `AGENTS.md` in the project root for full instructions.

## Context Files

- `AGENTS.md` — Universal agent instructions and project rules.
- `.agent/PROJECT.md` — Tech stack, vision, and architecture.
- `.agent/STATE.md` — Current task context. Read this FIRST every session.
- `.agent/ROADMAP.md` — Strategic milestones and phases.

## Workflow Protocol

Use the GSD protocol for all development tasks:
1. Discuss — Understand the task fully before acting.
2. Plan — Create a plan with clear verification steps.
3. Execute — Implement in atomic, testable steps.
4. Verify — Confirm each step works before proceeding.

## Skills

Specialized guides are in `.agent/skills/`. Each skill directory contains a `SKILL.md`.
Check for a relevant skill before starting any task.
